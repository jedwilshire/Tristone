# Tristone
 A two player strategy game.
 Rules are simple.  Players take turns choosing between 3 shapes of 3 different colors to place anywhere on a 5 x 5 grid board.
 If the placement of a shape results in 3 or more shapes of the same shape or same color, then all shapes in the score are removed,
 and the amount of shapes removed results in an increase in points for the player.
 First player to 20 points wins.
